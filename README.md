## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{Reece: With the analytics project I hope to introduce myself to the world of crime statistics while also gaining an in-depth understanding of the usefulness this data can provide to society. I have only recently started an interest in analytics, however, I have always been fascinated by crime. Crime statistics has been influencing police procedures for many years and has only gained in popularity since its introduction. I would like to explore the effectiveness of authorities that analyze and interpret the information given from these reports. As in, I would like to investigate whether there are any noticeable changes in the rate of crime at a criminal hotspot after a certain amount of time has gone by. As well as, how long does it take for the Boston police Department to actually enact a noticeable change that affects the crime rate in locations around Boston with large amounts of criminal activity.
Sophie: For my analytics projects I’m hoping to examine the crime incident reports data in Boston to identify trends. I am interested in analyzing what types of crimes occur in certain districts and why they occur. Detecting patterns like this and linking them with other determinants such as socioeconomic factors may lead to revelations regarding equality and safety within the Boston community. Another intriguing question would be if specific major events, for example an election, would impact the city's crime rate. I’m very fascinated with crime and murder documentaries and the reaccuring patterns that they develop over time. I thought this data set would be very interesting and relevant as it could represent similar patterns of other major cities in North America, such as Vancouver or Seattle. I could imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset because visualizing this data could be a great tool to analyze certain patterns and spot trends regarding the crime incident reports. An example of an impactful visualization could be a map of Boston with all the reported crimes within the last 24 hours.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{Our data set, Crimes in Boston, gives a detailed collection of crime incident reports provided by the Boston police department. Along with the initial report, the data set includes the description of the incident, the district and reporting areas it occurred, and specifically states whether a shooting transpired. Additionally, the data is recorded over a three year period which spans from June 14, 2015 until September 3, 2018. We believe the purpose of our data set allows the Boston Police Department to be transparent with the public regarding criminal activity in Boston. This also aids in keeping citizens safe as the public is now more knowledgeable about areas to avoid at certain times, and the general criminal trends occuring around Boston. These criminal trends can also be used to better prepare the police department in implementing more effective preventative measures such as situating themselves in areas where crimes are more likely to occur. The Boston Police Department records the data which is concatenated by Analyze Boston, the city of Boston’s open data hub.}
