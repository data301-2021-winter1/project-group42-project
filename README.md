## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{Reece: With the analytics project I hope to introduce myself to the world of crime statistics while also gaining an in-depth understanding of the usefulness this data can provide to society. I have only recently started an interest in analytics, however, I have always been fascinated by crime. Crime statistics has been influencing police procedures for many years and has only gained in popularity since its introduction. I would like to explore the effectiveness of authorities that analyze and interpret the information given from these reports. As in, I would like to investigate whether there are any noticeable changes in the rate of crime at a criminal hotspot after a certain amount of time has gone by. As well as, how long does it take for the Boston police Department to actually enact a noticeable change that affects the crime rate in locations around Boston with large amounts of criminal activity.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{Our data set, Crimes in Boston, gives a detailed collection of crime incident reports provided by the Boston police department. Along with the initial report, the data set includes the description of the incident, the district and reporting areas it occurred, and specifically states whether a shooting transpired. Additionally, the data is recorded over a three year period which spans from June 14, 2015 until September 3, 2018. We believe the purpose of our data set allows the Boston Police Department to be transparent with the public regarding criminal activity in Boston. This also aids in keeping citizens safe as the public is now more knowledgeable about areas to avoid at certain times, and the general criminal trends occuring around Boston. These criminal trends can also be used to better prepare the police department in implementing more effective preventative measures such as situating themselves in areas where crimes are more likely to occur. The Boston Police Department records the data which is concatenated by Analyze Boston, the city of Bostonâ€™s open data hub.}
